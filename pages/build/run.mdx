# Testing and First Run
Once you've assembled your bot and installed the necessary software, a premade inference model exists that can be used as a demo for testing.

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
We've demonstrated policy deployment on the robot, however this is still under heavy development as we continue to work on reliability of the system.
</Callout>

<Steps>
### Conda
First, set up your Python virtual environment that will allow you to interact using the [Python SDK](/sdk/python-library).

Clone repository:
```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/zeroth-robotics/zeroth-bot
cd zeroth-bot
```

Create conda environment:
(install Mini Conda [here](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) if you haven't done it yet)

```bash
conda create -n humanoid-os python=3.12
conda activate humanoid-os
```

### Inference
Ping the Milk-V board to verify your connection is working. Finally, you're ready to test everything together using the demo inference model.

Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r experiments/requirements.txt
```

Test if ping Milk-V is working:
```bash
ping 192.168.42.1
```

Run inference:
```bash
python experiments/run.py
```

If your robot is moving... 

Congratulations! Your Zeroth-01 bot is now assembled, connected, and ready for development.
