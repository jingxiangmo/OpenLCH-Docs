# Assembly Guide
<Callout type="error" emoji="🚫">
Public Alpha. Zeroth-01 Bot is available for basic demos, please expect breaking changes until 1.0 is reached.
</Callout>
**Notes:**

- All screws should have spring washers to prevent loosening, especially on legs and hips.
- Use an **M3x8 screw** for the middle screw on every servo.

<Steps>

### 1. Prepare Components

- Remove all supports and prepare components for assembly.

### 2. Assemble Ankle Pitch Servos to Feet

- Connect the left and right ankle **pitch servos** to the feet.

  <Image src="/assemble/IMG_3526.webp" alt="Connecting ankle pitch servos - Step 2" width={240} height={180} />
</div>

### 3. Attach Servo Casings

- Secure the servo casings to the ankle pitch servos.

### 4. Install Knee Pitch Servos and Wiring

- Attach the right and left **knee pitch servos** to the assembly.
- Connect the wire from the right foot to the **left port** of the knee servo.
- Add a new wire to the **right port** of the knee servo.
- Repeat for the left leg (mirrored configuration).

### 5. Assemble Knees and Hip Roll Servos

- Connect knee parts to the right and left knee pitch servos.
- Attach the left and right **hip roll servos** and the backs of knees/hip yaw connectors.

<div className="grid grid-cols-3 gap-4">
  <Image src="/assemble/IMG_3541.webp" alt="Knee assembly - Step 1" width={192} height={144} />

  <Image src="/assemble/IMG_3547.webp" alt="Knee assembly - Step 4" width={192} height={144} />
</div>

### 6. Verify Wiring Configuration

- Ensure the wire configuration on the right leg matches the images below.
- The left leg wiring should be mirrored accordingly.

<div className="grid grid-cols-2 gap-4">
  <Image src="/assemble/IMG_3549.webp" alt="Right leg wiring configuration" width={480} height={360} />
  <Image src="/assemble/IMG_3585.webp" alt="Wiring configuration detail" width={240} height={180} />
</div>

### 7. Secure Torso

- Use four **M3x12 screws** and four nuts to secure the torso as shown.

<Image src="/assemble/IMG_3585.webp" alt="Securing the torso" width={240} height={180} />

### 8. Attach Hip Yaw Servos to Legs

- Connect the right and left **hip yaw servos** to the legs and then to the hip connectors.
- **Important:** Do **not** attach the torso-connecting servos at this point.
- You should now have two legs with four servos each, **not yet connected to the torso**.

<div className="grid grid-cols-2 gap-4">
  <Image src="/assemble/IMG_3586.webp" alt="Attaching hip yaw servos - Step 1" width={3024} height={2268} />
  <Image src="/assemble/IMG_3582.webp" alt="Attaching hip yaw servos - Step 2" width={3024} height={2268} />
</div>

### 9. Prepare Hip Pitch Servos Wiring

- Connect a short and a long wire to the **hip pitch servo** that connects to the torso (red-striped servo).
- **Note:** In the image below, the wires are plugged into the wrong ports; they should be switched.
- Thread the **long wire** up towards the head.
- Thread the **short wire** through the back hole to the top thigh.
- **Important:** Do **not** attach the hip pitch servo to the leg yet, as it will prevent securing it to the torso.

<Image src="/assemble/IMG_3592.webp" alt="Hip pitch servo wiring" width={3024} height={2268} />

### 10. Attach Hip Pitch Servos to Torso

- Secure the right and left hip pitch servos to the torso.
- **Note:** The orange parts should not be connected to the legs yet.

<Image src="/assemble/IMG_3587.webp" alt="Attaching hip pitch servos to torso" width={3024} height={2268} />

### 11. Connect Legs to Hip Pitch Servos

- Attach the assembled legs to the hip pitch servos.
- The legs are now securely connected to the torso.

*(Refer to the image from Step 10, now with legs attached.)*

### 12. Install Shoulder Pitch Servos

- Secure the right and left **shoulder pitch servos** (black-striped servos) to the torso.

<Image src="/assemble/IMG_3571.webp" alt="Installing shoulder pitch servos - Step 1" width={3024} height={2268} />
<Image src="/assemble/IMG_3572.webp" alt="Installing shoulder pitch servos - Step 2" width={3024} height={2268} />

### 13. Attach Shoulders to Torso

- Attach the shoulders onto the torso using screws.

<Image src="/assemble/IMG_3573.webp" alt="Attaching shoulders to torso" width={3024} height={2268} />
<Image src="/assemble/IMG_3578.webp" alt="Shoulder attachment detail" width={3024} height={2268} />

### 14. Assemble Arms

- Screw together the **shoulder yaw** and **elbow yaw servos** for both arms.
- The assembled arms should look like the image below.

<Image src="/assemble/IMG_3575.webp" alt="Arm assembly" width={3024} height={2268} />

### 15. Attach Shoulder Yaw Servos to Shoulders

- Connect the shoulder yaw servos to the shoulders.

<Image src="/assemble/IMG_3589.webp" alt="Attaching shoulder yaw servos" width={3024} height={2268} />

### 16. Connect Wiring for Shoulder Servos

- Connect **long wires** to the body-side port on the shoulder yaw servos.
- Thread the wires through the holes towards the head.

<Image src="/assemble/IMG_3595.webp" alt="Shoulder servo wiring" width={3024} height={2268} />
<Image src="/assemble/IMG_3593.webp" alt="Shoulder wiring detail" width={3024} height={2268} />

### 17. Connect Elbow Yaw Servos

- Connect **shorter wires** from the unused port on the shoulder yaw servo to the corresponding port on the elbow yaw servo.

### 18. Attach Hands

- Attach the hands to the ends of the arms.

### 19. Final Assembly

- Your robot should now look like the image below.

<Image src="/assemble/IMG_3599.webp" alt="Final assembled robot" width={3024} height={2268} />

</Steps>
