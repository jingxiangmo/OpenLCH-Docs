# Software Setup
The OpenLCH humanoid robot platform provides convenient access to your Zeroth-01 Bot, including a simple-to-use API for interacting with MilkV boards over both USB and ssh. Follow this guide to setup and install the OpenLCH image on your SD card and connect to your Zeroth-01 Bot for the first time.

# Image Installation and Setup

<Steps>

### Flash the Image to SD Card

Use balenaEtcher (or the flashing tool of your choice) to flash the OpenLCH image onto your SD card.

1. Optional: [Download balenaEtcher](https://etcher.balena.io/#download-etcher) or
[Install balenaEtcher using command line](https://etcher-docs.balena.io/)
2. Download the OpenLCH image from the [releases page](https://github.com/Zeroth-Robotics/OpenLCH-buildroot/releases)
<p className="orderedlist-addon">Use the search input and double check you are downloading the OpenLCH image, not a different resource.</p>

3. Once flashing is complete, remove and reinsert the SD card into your computer.

### Configure Wi-Fi on Startup
Open the boot folder on the SD card (it should be visible on macOS since it is formatted as FAT32).
Create a new file named wpa_supplicant.conf in the boot folder and add the following content:

```bash
ctrl_interface=/var/run/wpa_supplicant
ap_scan=1
update_config=1

network={
  ssid="YOURWIFINAME"
  psk="YOURPASSWORD"
  key_mgmt=WPA-PSK
}
```
Replace YOURWIFINAME and YOURPASSWORD with your Wi-Fi credentials.

### Connect via USB
If you're connecting via USB, use the following details:

- IP Address: 192.168.42.1
- Username: root
- Password: milkv

SSH:
`ssh root@192.168.42.1`

If there's a keygen issue:
`ssh-keygen -R 192.168.42.1`
</Steps>
