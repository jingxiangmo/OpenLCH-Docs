## Image Installation and Setup

1. Flash the Image to the SD Card
Download the OpenLCH image from the [releases page](https://github.com/Zeroth-Robotics/OpenLCH-buildroot/releases).

Use Balena Etcher (or any other flashing tool) to flash the image onto your SD card.

Once flashing is complete, remove and reinsert the SD card into your computer.

3. Configure Wi-Fi on Startup
Open the boot folder on the SD card (it should be visible on macOS since it is formatted as FAT32).
Create a new file named wpa_supplicant.conf in the boot folder and add the following content:

```bash
ctrl_interface=/var/run/wpa_supplicant
ap_scan=1
update_config=1

network={
  ssid="YOURWIFINAME"
  psk="YOURPASSWORD"
  key_mgmt=WPA-PSK
}
```
Replace YOURWIFINAME and YOURPASSWORD with your Wi-Fi credentials.

3. Connect via USB
If you're connecting via USB, use the following details:

- IP Address: 192.168.42.1
- Username: root
- Password: milkv

SSH:
`ssh root@192.168.42.1`


If there's a keygen issue:
`ssh-keygen -R 192.168.42.1`




If the board is connected over usb, ip is `192.168.42.1`
