# Software Setup
Zeroth-01 bots are controlled by a simple-to-use [Python SDK](/sdk/python-library). Follow these instructions to install the OpenLCH humanoid robot platform on your SD card and connect with the Python SDK on your Zeroth-01 bot for the first time.

# Image Installation and Setup

<Steps>

### Flash the Image to SD Card
Use balenaEtcher (or the flashing tool of your choice) to flash the OpenLCH image onto your SD card.

([Download balenaEtcher](https://etcher.balena.io/#download-etcher) or
[Install balenaEtcher via command line](https://etcher-docs.balena.io/))

1. Download the OpenLCH image from the [releases page](https://github.com/Zeroth-Robotics/OpenLCH-buildroot/releases?q=openlch).

<p className="image-caption">Double check you are downloading the OpenLCH image, and not a different resource.</p>

2. Use the flashing tool to flash the image to your SD card.

3. Once flashing is complete, remove and reinsert the SD card into your computer.

### Option 1: Connect via USB
The Zeroth-01 can be connected to over USB using ssh.

If you're connecting via USB, use the following details:

- IP Address: 192.168.42.1
- Username: root
- Password: milkv

SSH:
```bash
ssh root@192.168.42.1
```

If there's a keygen issue:
```bash
ssh-keygen -R 192.168.42.1
```

### Option 2: Connect via Wifi
After connecting via USB for the first time, it's possible to set up [connection over wifi](/sdk/python-library#wi-fi-configuration).

### Next Steps
Now that you've connected to your Zeroth-01 bot for the first time, it's time for [testing and your first run](/build/run).
